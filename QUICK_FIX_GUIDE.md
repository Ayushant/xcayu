   lsof -i :5000                 # Mac/Linux
   ```

2. **Verify MongoDB has the license:**
   ```bash
   mongo
   use quiz-app
   db.licenses.count()  # Should be > 0
   ```

3. **Try script again:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/createCollegeLicense.js
   ```

### Quiz Still Showing Q1 After Refresh?

1. **Clear browser cache:**
   - DevTools → Application → Clear site data

2. **Check console for errors:**
   - DevTools → Console tab
   - Look for error messages

3. **Verify component is updated:**
   - Check RankingQuiz.jsx lines 119-145
   - Should have safety guards for quiz prop
