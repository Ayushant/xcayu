## Testing Checklist

### Backend API Tests (Using curl or Postman)

**1. Test Quiz Start**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/quiz-progress/start \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"quizId": "YOUR_QUIZ_ID"}'
```

**2. Test Answer Saving**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/quiz-progress/YOUR_QUIZ_ID/answer \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "questionIndex": 0,
    "selectedRanking": [{"text": "Option A", "rank": 1}],
    "instruction": "Strategy explanation..."
  }'
```
- [ ] Response shows saved question
- [ ] `totalAnswered` increments

- [ ] Can see decimal points on options (e.g., "2.5 points")
- [ ] Answer required fields show validation
- [ ] Save answer (no modal or confirmation)
- [ ] Next question loads

**2. Progress Resume**
- [ ] Answer question 1-3
- [ ] Refresh page (F5)
- [ ] Quiz should resume from question 3 or later
- [ ] Previous answers are preserved
- [ ] Progress bar shows correct percentage

**3. Duplicate Submission Prevention**
- [ ] Complete and submit quiz
- [ ] Try to open quiz again
- [ ] Should see error: "Quiz already submitted"
- [ ] Shows previous score and submission time

**4. Impact Display After Completion**
- [ ] Submit quiz
- [ ] View results
- [ ] Should see "Strategic Impact Analysis" section
- [ ] Only selected options' impacts shown
- [ ] Each impact grouped by rank
- [ ] Decimal points displayed correctly

**5. Quiz Builder (Admin)**
- [ ] Create new quiz
- [ ] Add question with multiple options
- [ ] For each option, set:
  - [ ] Text
  - [ ] Correct rank (1, 2, 3, 4...)
  - [ ] **Points** (e.g., 2.5, 5.5) - NEW
  - [ ] **Impact** (strategy description) - NEW
- [ ] Save quiz
- [ ] Verify in database that points and impact are stored

## Database Verification

### Check QuizProgress Collection
```javascript
// MongoDB shell
db.quizprogresses.findOne({status: "in-progress"})
// Should show:
// {
//   student: ObjectId,
//   quiz: ObjectId,
//   currentQuestion: Number,
//   answeredQuestions: Array,
//   status: "in-progress",
//   sessionId: String,
//   ...
// }
```

### Check Quiz Model Updates
```javascript
// MongoDB shell
db.quizzes.findOne({questions: {$exists: true}})
// Should show options with:
// {
//   text: String,
//   correctRank: Number,
//   points: Number,  // NEW - e.g., 2.5
//   impact: String   // NEW - e.g., "Increases market share"
// }
```

### Check Score Document
```javascript
// MongoDB shell
db.scores.findOne({status: "completed"})
// Should show:
// {
//   totalScore: Number,  // With decimals if options had decimal points
//   answers: [{
//     points: Number,  // Can be decimal
//     ...
//   }]
// }
```

## Browser Console Verification

In browser DevTools console after taking quiz:

```javascript
// Check localStorage for quiz session
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('quizSession_QUIZID'))

// Check for any errors
// Should see no errors, only info logs

// Verify API calls
// Network tab should show:
// POST /api/quiz-progress/start
// POST /api/quiz-progress/:id/answer (multiple)
// POST /api/scores/submit
// GET /api/quiz-progress/:id/results/:scoreId
```

## Feature Validation

### Feature 1: Remove Previous Button
- [ ] Quiz component shows only "Next" and "Submit" buttons
- [ ] No backward navigation possible
- [ ] UI doesn't include Previous arrow/button

### Feature 2: Prevent Re-submission
- [ ] Submitted quiz shows error when accessed again
- [ ] Error message includes score and submission time
- [ ] Backend rejects duplicate submission attempts

### Feature 3: Resume from Last Question
- [ ] Progress saved per-question in database
- [ ] On page refresh, quiz resumes from last answered question
- [ ] No loss of data or progress
- [ ] Test with 5+ questions to verify

### Feature 4: Decimal Points
- [ ] Quiz builder accepts decimal values (2.5, 5.5, etc.)
- [ ] Points display in quiz: "Points: 2.5"
- [ ] Calculation preserves decimals: (2.5 + 5.5 + 1.0) = 9.0
- [ ] Score stores as decimal: 9.5/10 = 95%

### Feature 5: Impact Text
- [ ] Impact text appears in results page
- [ ] Only selected options' impacts shown
- [ ] Organized by rank/priority
- [ ] Shows with decimal points

### Feature 6: Login Through Simulation (Existing)
- [ ] Student can only access quiz through simulation
- [ ] No direct quiz access without simulation context
- [ ] Session maintains simulation context

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Decimal Points Not Calculating
```
Symptom: Score shows as whole number despite decimal points
Solution: 
- Check quizModel.js has "points: Number" not "points: Integer"
- Verify quizSubmissionController uses parseFloat()
- Clear database and recreate quiz
```

### Issue: Progress Not Resuming
```
Symptom: Page refresh starts quiz from question 0
Solution:
- Verify quizProgressModel.js created in database
- Check authMiddleware.js working (req.user._id present)
- Check browser localStorage/IndexedDB not cleared
- Verify Server.js imported and registered routes
```

### Issue: "Previous Button Still Shows"
```
Symptom: Quiz component shows Previous/Back button
Solution:
- Replace QuizPreface.jsx navigation completely
- Check EnhancedQuiz.jsx is being used (not old component)
- Verify import in EnhancedStudentDashboard.jsx
- No conditional rendering of Previous button
```

### Issue: Impact Not Showing
```
Symptom: Results page doesn't show impact section
Solution:
- Verify ImpactDisplay.jsx imported in QuizResults.jsx
- Check quiz has impact text for options
- Verify answer.impacts array populated from server
- Check response from /api/quiz-progress/:id/results/:scoreId
```

### Issue: Decimal Points Showing as Percentage
```
Symptom: 2.5 points shows as "250%"
Solution:
- Don't divide by 100 for decimal points
- Divide only for final percentage calculation
- Keep raw decimal point in display
- Format with .toFixed(1) for consistency
```

## Performance Verification

### Load Testing (Small Scale)
- [ ] Open quiz: < 2 seconds initial load
- [ ] Next question: < 500ms
- [ ] Save answer: < 1 second
- [ ] Submit quiz: < 2 seconds
- [ ] View results: < 1 second

### Database Queries Optimization
- [ ] Indexes on `{ student: 1, quiz: 1, status: 1 }`
- [ ] No N+1 queries on quiz load
- [ ] Results fetch with single aggregation query

## Security Verification

- [ ] Cannot access quiz if not enrolled in course
- [ ] Cannot view other students' results
- [ ] Cannot modify submitted scores via API
- [ ] JWT token properly validated on all endpoints
- [ ] Admin can view all results for their college
- [ ] Impact text doesn't expose sensitive data

## Final Verification Steps

1. **End-to-End Test**
   - [ ] Student logs in through simulation
   - [ ] Selects new quiz
   - [ ] Answers all questions (with decimal point options)
   - [ ] Submits successfully
   - [ ] Views results with impact text
   - [ ] Tries to re-attempt (blocked with error)

2. **Admin Test**
   - [ ] Create quiz with decimal points and impact
   - [ ] View student submissions
   - [ ] See impact text in admin view
   - [ ] Verify decimal points in reports

3. **College Admin Test**
   - [ ] View all submissions for college
   - [ ] See impact analysis
   - [ ] Export results with decimal points

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Backend logs show clean operations
- [ ] Database migration completed
- [ ] Indexes created
- [ ] Environment variables set correctly
- [ ] CORS headers include frontend URL
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is strong and unique
- [ ] Backup existing data
- [ ] Test in staging environment first

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. Revert `Server.js` to remove quiz-progress routes
2. Keep quizProgressModel and controller files (safe)
3. Restore original quizModel.js (remove points/impact)
4. Restore original quizSubmissionController.js
5. Restart server
6. Existing quizzes will work (without new features)

## Support & Debugging

Enable detailed logging:

```javascript
// In quizProgressController.js
console.log('🔍 DEBUG:', { questionIndex, instruction, sessionId });

// In EnhancedQuiz.jsx
console.log('📊 Quiz Progress:', { currentQuestion, totalAnswered, progressPercent });

// In useQuizProgress hook
console.log('🎯 API Response:', response.data.data);
```

Monitor logs:
```bash
# Backend
tail -f Backend/logs/server.log

# Browser DevTools
Open Developer Tools → Console tab
```
