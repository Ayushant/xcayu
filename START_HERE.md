## 🎓 Understanding the Fix

**The Problem:**
- Frontend was using `currentQuestion` field to resume
- This field didn't indicate which question was "next to answer"
- So it would resume from a question already answered

**The Solution:**
- Frontend now looks at `answeredQuestions` array
- Counts how many questions were answered
- Calculates next question as: `max(answered indices) + 1`
- Resumes from that next unanswered question

**Example Math:**
```
Answered: Q at index 0, Q at index 1, Q at index 2
Next: max(0,1,2) + 1 = 3
Show: Question at index 3 ✅
```
