## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still showing wrong score
**Solution:** 
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Take a NEW quiz (old scores use old logic)
- Restart backend server

### Issue: Backend error
**Solution:**
- Check Backend/controllers/quizSubmissionController.js
- Line 85-108 should have the new fix
- Run: `npm install` in Backend folder

### Issue: Can't drag options
**Solution:**
- This is a frontend issue, not related to this fix
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure drag-and-drop library is loaded

---

## 🎯 What Changed

**File:** `Backend/controllers/quizSubmissionController.js`

**Change:** Lines 85-100

**Old Logic:**
```javascript
// Scored based on how well ALL options were ranked
const rankingScore = calculateTotalRankingScore(answer.selectedRanking, correctRanking);
```

**New Logic:**
```javascript
// Score based ONLY on which option is at rank 1 (top)
const studentTopChoice = answer.selectedRanking.find(opt => opt.rank === 1);
const selectedOption = question.options.find(opt => opt.text === studentTopChoice?.text);
points = selectedOption?.points || selectedOption?.marks || 0;
```

## 📞 If Issues Persist

**Check:**
1. ✅ Backend running on port 5000
2. ✅ Frontend running on port 3000
3. ✅ MongoDB connected
4. ✅ Browser cache cleared
5. ✅ Taking NEW quiz (not viewing old score)

**Backend Console Should Show:**
```
📊 Question 1 Scoring: { ... }
=== 🎯 QUIZ SCORING SUMMARY ===
```

If not seeing these logs, the fix isn't being executed.

---

**Status:** ✅ Fix Applied & Ready to Test

**Time Required:** 5 minutes

**Expected Result:** Dragging option 4 to top now gives correct points (10/16 instead of 6/16)
