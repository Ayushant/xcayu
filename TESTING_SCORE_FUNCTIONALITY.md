# 🧪 Score Functionality - Testing Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Route Hyphenation (Backend)
- **File**: `Backend/Server.js` (Line 117)
- **Change**: Added `/api/college-admin` route alias
- **Why**: Frontend calls with hyphen, backend had it without

### 2. Score Modal Display (Frontend)
- **File**: `Frontend/src/components/AdminScoreEditModal.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Now accepts `scoreId` prop and auto-fetches
  - Shows loading state while fetching
  - Uses `api` instance instead of `axios`
  - Proper error handling with modal close

### 3. SuperAdmin Integration (Frontend)
- **File**: `Frontend/src/pages/SuperAdminDashboard.jsx`
- **Change**: Pass `scoreId` instead of `score` to modal, use `onSave` callback

## API Endpoints (Test with Thunder Client / Postman)

### College Admin Endpoints
```
# Get all scores for college
GET http://localhost:5000/api/college-admin/scores
Header: Authorization: Bearer {token}

# Get single score details
GET http://localhost:5000/api/college-admin/score-details/{scoreId}
Header: Authorization: Bearer {token}

# Edit score
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/college-admin/score-edit/{scoreId}
Header: Authorization: Bearer {token}
Body: {
  "newScore": 85,
  "reason": "Recalculated based on new rubric"
}
```

### SuperAdmin Endpoints
```
# Get all scores
GET http://localhost:5000/api/scores
Header: Authorization: Bearer {token}

# Get single score
GET http://localhost:5000/api/scores/{scoreId}
Header: Authorization: Bearer {token}

# Edit score
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/scores/{scoreId}/edit

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Should Work
- College admin sees only their college's scores
- SuperAdmin sees all scores from all colleges
- Clicking Edit opens modal with loading state
- Score details load and display correctly
- Editing score with reason saves successfully
- Success toast appears
- List refreshes after save
- Socket.IO sends real-time notifications
- Edit history is recorded

### ❌ Should Fail Gracefully
- Accessing another college's scores → 403 Forbidden
- Invalid score value (>100) → Validation error message
- No reason provided → "Please provide a reason" message
- Network error → Error toast with details
- Score not found → Modal closes with error

---

## Debug Commands

### Check College Admin Login
```bash
# In browser DevTools Console
localStorage.getItem('user')
# Should show: college: "gtu", role: "collegeAdmin"

localStorage.getItem('token')
# Should show valid JWT token
```

### Check Score Fetch in Network Tab
```
Request: GET /api/college-admin/scores
Response: Array of score objects
Status: 200 OK

Request: GET /api/college-admin/score-details/{id}
Response: Single score with all details
Status: 200 OK
```

### Check Socket.IO Events
```javascript
// In browser DevTools Console
// Should see messages like:
// "📡 Emitting score-edited event to college: gtu"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Modal not appearing after click
**Check**:
- [ ] Browser console for errors
- [ ] Network tab for failed requests
- [ ] Token valid? `localStorage.getItem('token')`
- [ ] Correct role? `localStorage.getItem('user')`

### Problem: 404 Error when loading score
**Check**:
- [ ] Route alias added in Server.js? (line 117)
- [ ] Backend restarted? 
- [ ] Correct scoreId? Check network response

### Problem: 403 Unauthorized
**Check**:
- [ ] User logged in?
- [ ] Correct college?
- [ ] Score belongs to college?

### Problem: Score doesn't update
**Check**:
- [ ] Reason provided?
- [ ] Score value 0-100?
- [ ] Backend console for errors
- [ ] Database updated? Check in MongoDB Compass
