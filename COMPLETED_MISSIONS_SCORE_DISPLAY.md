## 🔧 Changes Made

### File Modified: `Frontend/src/components/student/StudentQuizList.jsx`

### 1. Added Score Display to Completed Missions Cards

**What Was Added:**
- **Score Badge Box** displaying the final score (numerator out of denominator)
- Beautiful gradient purple design matching the app's theme
- Shows: `XX / YY` format where:
  - XX = Student's earned score
  - YY = Maximum possible marks (from Super Admin settings)

**Visual Design:**
```jsx
┌────────────────────┐
│       42           │  ← Student's Score (large, bold)
│     out of         │  ← Label
│       50           │  ← Max Marks (medium, bold)
└────────────────────┘
```

**Styling:**
- Size: 140px × 140px
- Background: Purple gradient (135deg, #667eea to #764ba2)
- Border: 3px white border with transparency
- Box shadow: Glowing purple effect
- Font: Black weight for numbers, bold for text

### 2. Made Completed Mission Cards Clickable

**Before:** Cards had `cursor: 'default'` - not clickable

**After:** Cards have `cursor: 'pointer'` - clickable with hover effects

**New Handler Function:**
```javascript
const handleViewCompletedMission = async (score) => {
  // Fetches full score details with all answers
  // Displays QuizResults component with complete breakdown
  // Shows detailed mission accomplished screen
}
```

### 3. Added Visual Click Indicator

At the bottom of each completed mission card:
- Icon: Eye symbol (view icon)
- Text: "Click to view detailed results"
- Style: Purple themed with gradient background
- Purpose: Makes it clear that cards are clickable

## 📊 Data Flow

### Score Data Structure:

```javascript
{
  _id: "score123",
  totalScore: 42,           // Student's earned score
  displayScore: 42,         // Backend-provided display score
  displayMaxMarks: 50,      // Super Admin's custom total (priority)
  maxMarks: 50,             // Quiz maximum marks
  percentage: 84,           // Calculated percentage
  answers: [...],           // Array of answer objects
  quiz: {
    _id: "quiz456",
    title: "Marketing Strategy",
    maxMarks: 50
  }
}
```

### Score Display Priority:
1. **Numerator:** `displayScore` → `totalScore`
2. **Denominator:** `displayMaxMarks` → `quiz.maxMarks`

This ensures Super Admin's custom totals are always respected.
