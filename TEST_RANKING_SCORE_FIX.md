## üêõ If Something's Wrong

### Problem: Still seeing "0 pts" for all options
**Solution**:
1. Make sure backend restarted successfully
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Verify you're taking a NEW quiz (not viewing old results)
4. Clear all browser cache and localStorage
5. Check that quiz has option points defined in admin panel

### Problem: Score calculation seems wrong
**Solution**:
1. Check backend logs for calculation details
2. Verify quiz setup has points assigned to each option
3. Manually calculate expected score using the formula
4. Compare with displayed score

### Problem: Frontend not showing new format
**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Clear all site data
3. Check that frontend files were updated
4. Verify no build errors in console

## üìä Understanding the Scoring

### Formula:
```
For each option:
- If exact position: Full points
- If wrong position: Points √ó ProximityScore √ó 0.5

ProximityScore = 1 - (|studentRank - correctRank| / (totalOptions - 1))
```

### Example (4 options, each worth 5 pts):
| Student Rank | Correct Rank | Position Diff | Proximity | Points Earned |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1            | 1            | 0             | 1.0       | 5.0 pts ‚úÖ    |
| 2            | 4            | 2             | 0.33      | 0.8 pts üü°    |
| 3            | 2            | 1             | 0.67      | 1.7 pts üü°    |
| 4            | 3            | 1             | 0.67      | 1.7 pts üü°    |

**Total: 9.2 / 20 pts (46%)**
