# 🔴 CRITICAL: Backend Server Not Reloaded

## 🔥 The Error

```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/quiz-progress/start 404 (Not Found)
```

**Meaning:** The backend server doesn't know about the `/api/quiz-progress` route yet!

---

## ✅ Solution: Complete Backend Restart

### Step 1: Kill the Backend Server
1. **Find the terminal with backend running**
2. **Press Ctrl+C** (hold Ctrl, press C)
3. **Wait for it to stop** (usually 1-2 seconds)

### Step 2: Verify It's Stopped
- The terminal should show: `(base) C:\Users\...Backend>`
- Or just a blank prompt

### Step 3: Restart Backend
```bash
cd "c:\Users\Tanmay Bari\Desktop\Xaction-main\Backend"
npm start
```

### Step 4: Wait for Server to Start
**Look for this in terminal:**
```
Server is running on PORT 5000
Socket.IO: Active
```

### Step 5: Refresh Browser
- Go to http://localhost:5173
- Press **Ctrl+F5** (hard refresh)
- Click to start a quiz

---

## 🧪 Expected Behavior After Restart

### In Backend Console:
```
Server is running on PORT 5000
URL: http://localhost:5000
Socket.IO: Active
```

### In Browser Console (F12):
```
🚀 Starting/Resuming quiz session...
📋 Start response: {success: true, ...}
```

### NOT This:
```
❌ POST http://localhost:5000/api/quiz-progress/start 404 (Not Found)
```

## 🆘 If Still Getting 404

**Step 1:** Check Backend Console
- Does it say "Server is running on PORT 5000"?
- Or any errors?

**Step 2:** Check .env file
- Backend/.env should have MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET

**Step 3:** Check quizProgressRoutes file exists
- `Backend/routes/quizProgressRoutes.js` should exist

**Step 4:** Check Server.js has the import
- Should have: `import quizProgressRoutes from "./routes/quizProgressRoutes.js";`

**Go kill and restart the backend server now!**
