## ❌ TROUBLESHOOTING: What If It's Still Wrong?

### Problem: Shows Question 1 After Refresh

**Screenshot Required:**
1. Take screenshot of screen (showing Q1)
2. Take screenshot of console (showing error/logs)
3. Share both with me

**Before Screenshotting, Try:**
```bash
# In Backend terminal (Ctrl+C to stop, then):
npm start

# In Frontend terminal (Ctrl+C to stop, then):
npm run dev

# In browser:
- Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete to clear cache
- Close all browser tabs
- Open fresh: http://localhost:5173
- Login again
- Try the test again
```

### Problem: Errors in Console

**Copy the error and share:**
- Look for red error messages in console
- Right-click on error → Copy
- Paste it in your message

Examples of common errors:
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'data' of undefined
TypeError: api is not defined
SyntaxError: Unexpected token
```

If you see any of these, screenshot the full error including:
- The error message
- The file name and line number
- The context around it

### Problem: Console is Empty/Not Showing Logs

**Try this:**
1. Refresh page (F5)
2. Immediately check console
3. Should see logs appearing in real-time
4. If still empty: Logs might be disabled

**To enable logs:**
- Browser might have log level filtering
- Look for dropdown next to "Console" that says "Default"
- Change to "Verbose" if available
