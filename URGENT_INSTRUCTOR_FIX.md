# ✅ URGENT FIX: Instructor Score Display Issue

## The Problem You Saw

When you clicked "Edit Score" and tried to add an instructor score:
- You saw input field with value "2"
- Clicked "Add Score" button
- Nothing seemed to happen ❌
- **Total Score editing worked fine** ✅

---

## Root Cause

The instructor score **WAS being saved** to the database, but the UI wasn't showing you the current value!

**What was missing:**
- No display of current instructor score
- You couldn't see if a score was already set
- You couldn't see the result after clicking "Add Score"

**Like this:**
```
Total Score            Instructor Score
   68%          vs.    [Input: 2]     ← Where's the current value?
  [Edit]               [Add Score]
```

---

## What I Fixed

Added the **current instructor score display** (just like Total Score):

```jsx
// Added this display above the input
<p className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-600 mb-2">
  {selectedScore.instructorScore !== undefined 
    ? `${selectedScore.instructorScore}%`   // Shows: "85%"
    : 'Not Set'}                             // Shows: "Not Set"
</p>
```

## How It Looks Now

### Before Fix
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│  Instructor Score      │
│  [Input: 2]            │  ← Confusing!
│  [Add Score]           │
└────────────────────────┘
```

### After Fix
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│  Instructor Score      │
│       85%              │  ← NEW! Clear display
│  [Enter new score]     │
│  [Update Score]        │
└────────────────────────┘
```

---

## Now It Works Like Total Score

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Total Score      │  Instructor Score    │
│     68%           │      85%             │  ← Both show current value
│   [Edit]          │   [Enter new]        │
│                   │   [Update Score]     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Quick Test (30 seconds)

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl + R or F5)
2. Click "Edit Score" again
3. Look at "Instructor Score" section
4. ✅ You should now see the current score displayed (like "2%" or "Not Set")
5. Enter a new score (e.g., 85)
6. Click "Add Score" or "Update Score"
7. ✅ The display will update to show "85%"

---

## What Was Changed

**File:** `Frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.jsx`

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added display of current instructor score value
2. ✅ Changed input placeholder to "Enter new score"
3. ✅ Button text now says "Add Score" or "Update Score" dynamically

**Lines changed:** ~10 lines

---

## Summary

**The button WAS working!** You just couldn't see the result because the display was missing.

Now:
- ✅ Current instructor score is visible
- ✅ You can see when it updates
- ✅ Button text changes (Add vs Update)
- ✅ Matches the Total Score UI pattern

**Just refresh your browser and try again!** 🎉

## Status

✅ **Fix complete**
✅ **No backend changes needed** (was already working)
✅ **Just UI display issue**
✅ **Ready to use immediately**

**Action:** Refresh browser (F5) and test!
